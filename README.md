# Multi-Object-Tracking-using-YOLOv5
This is a Multi object tracker. Mainly it was build for tracking car movement in a junction. It will track each car with unique ID from entering a junction until leaving to another junction.

# Defishing
To defish a fisheye image one can execute the section of 'Defishing'. A folder containing all fisheye images can be defished by executing 'main.py' in defishing folder. A video will be saved containing all defished images.
